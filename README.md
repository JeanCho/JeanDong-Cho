SO1: Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
SO2: Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the programâ€™s discipline.
SO6: Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.


#All codes are done on Linux Ubuntu Versions 19 to 20.04
